                <h1>Income and Expenses</h1>
                <p>

                <h1>Emergency Fund</h1>
                <p>
                    Building and maintaining an emergency fund is a fundamental part of personal budgeting. Aim to set aside three to six months' worth of living expenses in case of unexpected events such as job loss, medical emergencies, or unforeseen expenses. An emergency fund provides a financial safety net and helps prevent the need to rely on credit in times of crisis.</p>

Consistent saving and investing can lead to long-term financial stability and growth.</p>
